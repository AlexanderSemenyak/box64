----

Box64 lets you run x86_64 Linux programs (such as games) on non-x86_64 Linux systems, like ARM (host system needs to be 64-bit little-endian).

You can find many Box64 videos on the [MicroLinux](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwFQAEj1lp3out4n7BeBatQ), [Pi Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgfQjdc5RceRlTGfuthBs7g) or [The Byteman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEr8lpIJ3B5Ctc5BvcOHSnA) YouTube channels.

Since Box64 uses the native versions of some "system" libraries, like libc, libm, SDL, and OpenGL, it's easy to integrate and use with most applications, and performance can be surprisingly high in many cases. Take a look at thoses bench analysis for an example [here](https://box86.org/index.php/2021/06/game-performances/).

Box64 integrates with DynaRec (dynamic recompiler) for the ARM64 platform, providing a speed boost between 5 to 10 times faster than using only the interpreter. Some high level information on how DynaRec works can be found [here](https://box86.org/2021/07/inner-workings-a-high%e2%80%91level-view-of-box86-and-a-low%e2%80%91level-view-of-the-dynarec/).

Some x64 internal opcodes use parts of "Realmode X86 Emulator Library", see [x64primop.c](../src/emu/x64primop.c) for copyright details

Usage
----

There are a few environment variables to control the behaviour of Box64.

See [here](USAGE.md) for all the environment variables and what they do.

Note: Box64's Dynarec uses a mechanism with Memory Protection and a SegFault signal handler to handle JIT code. In simpler terms, if you want to use GDB to debug a running program that use JIT'd code (like mono/Unity3D), you will still have many "normal" segfaults triggering. It is suggested to use something like `handle SIGSEGV nostop` in GDB to not stop at each segfault, and maybe put a breakpoint inside `my_memprotectionhandler` in `signals.c` if you want to trap SegFaults.

Version history/Change log

Notes about 32-bit platforms
----

Because Box64 works by directly translating function calls from x86_64 to host system, the host system (the one Box64 is running on) needs to have 64-bit libraries. Box64 doesn't include any 64-bit <-> 32-bit translation. 

So understand that box64 will only runs 64-bit linux binaries. For 32-bit binaries, you need box86 (with all the multiarch or proot trickery it imply on 64-bit OS).
Note that many installer (mojo setup based) will fall back to "x86" when detecting ARM64 OS, and so will try to use box86 for the setup, even if an x86_64 version exist. You can hack your way around with a fake "uname" that return "x86_64" when the argument is "-m"

Notes about Unity game emulation
----

Running Unity games is a hit or miss for now. Unity uses Mono (which uses signals that are not always emulated in a 100% accurate way).
You should also note that some Unity3D games require OpenGL 3+ which can be tricky to provide on ARM SBC (single-board computers).
So, not all Unity games work and can require a high OpenGL profile, but many actualy work now.
Hint: on Pi4, use `MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.2` and with Panfrost use `PAN_MESA_DEBUG=gl3` to use higher profile if the game starts then quits before showing anything.

Notes about GTK programs
----

GTK libraries are now wrapped on box64, bu only gtk2, not gtk3 (contrary to box86).

----

Notes about Steam
----

Note that Steam is a hybrid 32-bit / 64-bit. You NEED box86 to run Steam, as the client app is a 32-bit binary. It also uses a 64-bit local server binaries, but like most stuff using libcef/chromium, it's not working correctly on box64 for now.
So, no Steam for now on box64.

----

Notes about Wine
----

Wine64 is supported on box64. Proton should also work. Be aware that 64-bit Wine also includes 32-bit components, to be able to run 32-bit Windows programs. The 32-bit apps will need box86 and will not run without it. On a system where both box64 and box86 are present and working, a wine 64-bit setup can run both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows programs (just use `wine` and `wine64` respectively)

Notes about Vulkan
----

Box64 wraps Vulkan libraries, but note that it as only been tested with a RX550 card, some extensions may be missing depending on your graphics card.
